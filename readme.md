# WhyB Spec
Where we ask why is `Why` equal to `Y`...  
WhyB Spec means Yolol Backend Specification  
**NOTICE:** This spec is very new and such, work in progress, expect potentially breaking changes  

The goal of this spec is to allow the separation of the editor and emulation to allow the use of multiple different emulators with a single editor of choice.  
Using this spec for the backend will help development speeds, by not having to worry about making a editor and are able to use existing tools to change and test the backend.  
The end users will then be able to use any editor they want with your backend.
